#Rock, Paper, Scissors
In a Rock, Paper, Scissors project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, HTML is used to create the structure of the game, defining elements like buttons and result displays. CSS is employed for styling, making the game visually appealing by designing buttons and layout. JavaScript adds interactivity by providing the game's logic, handling user input, generating computer choices, and determining the winner based on the selected options. The combination of these technologies results in an interactive web-based game where users can play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer and see the outcomes dynamically displayed on the webpage.
